## Overview

A platform where users can post letters to a "letter board" when they need encouragement or want to vent. The application allows others to respond to these letters, offering support and kindness. The goal is to create a friendly, uplifting environment that brightens someone's day.

Many people experience feelings of isolation or sadness and could benefit from positive, uplifting messages to brighten their day. While social media allows for sharing updates, it lacks a dedicated space where users can anonymously send and receive encouragement within a supportive community. Dear Sunshine addresses this gap by providing a platform where users can receive kind messages in response to what they've shared or vented about on the board.

Our team is committed to following the GitHub hosting guidelines to ensure a seamless and professional project development experience. We are hosting all essential source code within the repository, while avoiding "derived" files that can be generated locally, such as the node_modules directory. This is managed by utilizing a .gitignore file to exclude non-essential files. We have established a dedicated GitHub organization for our team-based development, where each member has "owner" status, ensuring equal collaboration and contribution. The project home page is maintained separately in a dear-sunshine.github.io repository using GitHub Pages, while the core application is developed in a distinct repository. Additionally, we are documenting our project thoroughly, including an overview, user guide, developer guide, and a detailed development history, adhering to the structured guidelines provided.
